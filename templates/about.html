    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>
      This website was built with the goal of promoting awareness about heart health 
      and leveraging technology to help people assess their risk of heart disease.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Using advanced Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier), 
      our model analyzes multiple health indicators â€” such as blood pressure, cholesterol, 
      and chest pain type â€” to provide predictions.  
    </p>
    <p>
      ðŸ’¡ This site was created with heart, hope, and the mission to encourage early health checkups.  
      Always consult a medical professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
